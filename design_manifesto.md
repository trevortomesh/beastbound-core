# BeastBound: Design Manifesto

**BeastBound** is not just a gameâ€”it's a gentle invitation into a world where stillness, silence, and presence matter.

## Guiding Principles

- **Faithful Design**: Subtle Christian themes are woven through the world: scripture, sacred beasts, and encounters that honor mercy, stillness, and grace.
- **No Rush, No Rage**: This is a calm experience. Players are encouraged to reflect, listen, and act with intention.
- **Echo & Memory**: Your choices, silences, and journaling shape how the world remembers you.
- **Communal Discovery**: Some Beasts will only be known because others found them. The world expands as the community journeys further.
