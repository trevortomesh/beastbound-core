# How to Submit a New Beast Discovery

## **Step 1: Discovery of a New Beast**
When you discover a new Beast, it will be assigned an ID number (e.g., `???`). The Beast's name will be shown as `???` until it is officially submitted and reviewed.

ChatGPT will provide the details of the new Beast, but you will need to **submit it for review** to make it part of the official canon.

## **Step 2: Provide Submission Details**
ChatGPT will prompt you to provide details for your new Beast:
1. **Name**: What do you wish to call this new Beast?
2. **Types**: What are the main types of this Beast? (e.g., "Echo", "Flame", etc.)
3. **Trait**: What unique trait does this Beast have? (e.g., "Fiery Heart")
4. **Moves**: List at least 3 moves this Beast can use.
5. **Description**: Write a short description of the Beast — what it looks like, how it behaves, and any lore.
6. **Region Spawn**: Where can this Beast be found? (e.g., "Azure Lake", "Blazegut Caverns")
7. **Encounter Condition**: How is this Beast discovered? (e.g., "Appears during the full moon", "Only in quiet forest areas")

## **Step 3: Generate the JSON Object for Your Submission**
ChatGPT will generate the **JSON object** for your new Beast based on your submission. Here's an example of how it will look:

```json
{
    "id": "???",
    "name": "Your Beast Name Here",
    "types": ["Type1", "Type2"],
    "trait": "Your Beast's Trait",
    "moves": ["Move1", "Move2", "Move3"],
    "description": "A brief description of the Beast.",
    "region_spawn": ["Region1", "Region2"],
    "encounter_condition": "How to discover the Beast."
}

Step 4: Submit the Beast

To officially submit your Beast and have it reviewed, follow these steps:
	1.	Go to the BeastBound GitHub Repository Issues page.
	2.	Click on New Issue.
	3.	Paste the following JSON object into the issue description, replacing the placeholders with the actual details you’ve provided.
	4.	Title the issue: “New Beast Submission: [Beast Name]”.
	5.	Submit the issue for review.

Once I review your submission, I’ll assign an official ID to your Beast and add it to the canon!
