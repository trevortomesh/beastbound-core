# How to Play BeastBound

BeastBound is a calm, spiritual, text-based role-playing game designed to be played inside ChatGPT. Your experience is shaped by silence, Scripture, choice, and reflection.

## 🌀 Getting Started with ChatGPT

1. **Visit:** [https://chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)
2. Make sure you're using **ChatGPT 4** (the GPT-4 model gives best results)
3. Use the following **prompt** to begin your game:

I want you to act as the interface for a text-based RPG called BeastBound.
It’s like a sacred version of Pokémon — contemplative, Christian-inspired, with 100 original Beasts to discover.
Start me on a journey, let me choose my first Beast, and guide the story forward one choice at a time.
Use gentle tone, ASCII maps for exploration, and let scripture and silence shape some encounters.

## 🧭 How the Game Works

- 🐾 **Choose your first Beast** — each has its own nature and spiritual resonance.
- 📜 **Make choices** — explore forests, ruins, shrines, and dream-places.
- 🧘‍♂️ **Use silence, Scripture, or stillness** — not all encounters are about strength.
- 📖 **Keep a journal** — the game may invite you to write down moments of grace, memory, or change.
- 🔁 **Play over time** — your adventure may pause and resume freely.

## 🛠 Game Tips

- Use commands like:
    - `w`, `a`, `s`, `d` — to move on ASCII maps
    - `e` — to interact with items or glyphs
    - `i` — to open your inventory
    - `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` — to make narrative choices

- Speak gently. Listen often. The Beasts know when you are present.

## 🌿 Sharing and Trading

Each Beast you catch has a unique ID. You can export and share your Beasts with other players (feature in progress).

Future versions may support:
- 🧬 Syncing Beast discoveries across players
- 📦 Importing Beasts into shared games
- 🌐 Publishing your journal or journey logs

## 🙏 Remember...

> *“You do not catch a sacred thing. You listen to it. And if you are quiet enough… it may listen back.”*
